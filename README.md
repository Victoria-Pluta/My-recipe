What I learned
-Built a second mini-site with zero layout help—just clean, semantic HTML.

-Practised ordered & unordered lists, proper heading hierarchy, and alt text.

-Embedded an external image and kept the file 100 % self-contained (no CSS).

-Validated the markup with W3C to catch tiny typos before committing.
